# Data streaming demo projects

- [Change Data Capture (CDC) Local Development with PostgreSQL, Debezium Server and Pub/Sub Emulator](https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-11-07-cdc-local-dev)
  - _Change data capture_ (CDC) is a data integration pattern to track changes in a database so that actions can be taken using the changed data. [_Debezium_](https://debezium.io/) is probably the most popular open source platform for CDC. Originally providing Kafka source connectors, it also supports a ready-to-use application called [Debezium server](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/operations/debezium-server.html). The standalone application can be used to stream change events to other messaging infrastructure such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Amazon Kinesis and Apache Pulsar. In this post, we develop a CDC solution locally using Docker. The source of the [theLook eCommerce](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce) is modified to generate data continuously, and the data is inserted into multiple tables of a PostgreSQL database. Among those tables, two of them are tracked by the Debezium server, and it pushes row-level changes of those tables into Pub/Sub topics on the [Pub/Sub emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator). Finally, messages of the topics are read by a Python application.
