# Data streaming demo projects

- [Change Data Capture (CDC) Local Development with PostgreSQL, Debezium Server and Pub/Sub Emulator](https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2024-11-07-cdc-local-dev)
  - _Change data capture_ (CDC) is a data integration pattern to track changes in a database so that actions can be taken using the changed data. [_Debezium_](https://debezium.io/) is probably the most popular open source platform for CDC. Originally providing Kafka source connectors, it also supports a ready-to-use application called [Debezium server](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/operations/debezium-server.html). The standalone application can be used to stream change events to other messaging infrastructure such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Amazon Kinesis and Apache Pulsar. In this post, we develop a CDC solution locally using Docker. The source of the [theLook eCommerce](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce) is modified to generate data continuously, and the data is inserted into multiple tables of a PostgreSQL database. Among those tables, two of them are tracked by the Debezium server, and it pushes row-level changes of those tables into Pub/Sub topics on the [Pub/Sub emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator). Finally, messages of the topics are read by a Python application.
- **Realtime Dashboard With FastAPI, Streamlit and Next.js**
  - Real-time monitoring dashboard applications. A data generating app is created with Python, and it ingests the [theLook eCommerce](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce) data continuously into a PostgreSQL database. A WebSocket server, built by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), periodically queries the data to serve its clients. The monitoring dashboards will be developed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), with [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) for visualization.

- **Getting Started with Kafka and Flink with Kotlin**
  - This five-part series walks through the evolution of an event-driven data pipeline, starting with basic Kafka clients and progressing to advanced real-time stream processing and analytics using Kafka Streams and Apache Flink. All implemented in Kotlin and centered around order events.

- **Building a Real-Time Product Recommender using Contextual Bandits**
  - [Prototyping a Live Product Recommender with Python](https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2026-01-29-prototype-recommender-with-python/): Traditional recommenders struggle with cold-start users and short-term context. Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits (CMAB) continuously learns online, balancing exploitation and exploration based on real-time context. In Part 1, we build a Python prototype to simulate user behavior and validate the algorithm, laying the groundwork for scalable, real-time recommendations.
